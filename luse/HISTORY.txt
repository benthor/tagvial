luse-1.0.3:
* Added support for absolute root dirs in fwfs example (thanks to Mauro Iazzi).
* Added binding for POSIX function lstat.
* Fixed parameter name/order for symlink, rename, link.
* Added a missing include statement in errno.c (string.h for strerror).
* Fixed the nlink value for directories in luafs.lua. That caused some
  troubles to find (thanks to Hisham Muhammad).
* Added luse.get_context function, to retrieve information about the current
  FUSE request (thanks to Hisham Muhammad).
* Renamed doc generation script to gendoc.lua. Added a makefile for doc
  generation.

luse-1.0.2:

* Added a mechanism to support several FUSE versions (with initial support for
  2.5 and 2.6 instead of only 2.6).
* Fixed some code convention ('char *' vs. 'char* ').
* Fixed a typo in the documentation ('developped' vs. 'developed').
* Removed partial support of init and destroy methods.

luse-1.0.1:

* Added posixio.getcwd to get the current working directory.
* Added constant posixio.PATH_MAX.
* Added errno.strerror to get an error string.
* Fixed a bug in fwfs: it did not use absolute path while it's necessary when
  the fuse process detaches from the console (when neither -d or -f are
  passed).

luse-1.0.0:

* First public version.
* Initial FUSE binding, hellofs, luafs and fwfs examples.
